# Fullstack Open â€” Part 1 (Completed)

This repository contains my completed **Part 1** of the [Fullstack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/) course by the University of Helsinki.

The exercises cover the fundamentals of React, including:
- Component structure and props  
- State management with `useState`  
- Event handling  
- Rendering dynamic content  

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project
Clone the repository and run it locally:
```bash
git clone <this-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-folder>
npm install
npm run dev
```

## ðŸ’¡ Additional Work

I also added custom **visual elements and styling** to refresh and improve my front-end design skills.  
This includes small UI experiments and aesthetic enhancements beyond the original exercises.

To enable the visuals, install the following dependencies:

```bash
npm install ogl
npm install gsap
```
Then open the link shown in your terminal (usually http://localhost:5173)

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack
- React (Vite)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS / custom styles
